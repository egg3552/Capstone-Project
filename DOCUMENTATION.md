# Django Blog Platform - Development Documentation

## Architecture Overview

This Django blog platform follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) pattern with additional custom components for enhanced functionality.

### Core Components

#### Models (`blog/models.py`)
- **UserProfile**: Extends Django's User model with role-based access (Reader, Author, Admin)
- **Category**: Post categorization system
- **Tag**: Flexible tagging system for content organization
- **Post**: Main content model with SEO optimization and status management
- **Comment**: Nested commenting system with moderation

#### Views (`blog/views.py`)
- **Class-Based Views**: For consistent CRUD operations
- **Function-Based Views**: For specific custom functionality
- **Permission Mixins**: Role-based access control
- **Search & Filter**: Advanced content discovery

#### Templates (`templates/`)
- **Base Template**: Consistent layout with responsive navigation
- **Post Templates**: List, detail, create, and edit views
- **Authentication**: Login, register, and profile management
- **Static Pages**: About, contact, and informational pages

## Database Schema

### User Management
```sql
-- Extended User Profile
UserProfile:
  - user (OneToOne to User)
  - role (Reader/Author/Admin)
  - bio (TextField)
  - avatar (ImageField)
  - created_at (DateTime)
```

### Content Management
```sql
-- Categories
Category:
  - name (CharField, unique)
  - slug (SlugField, unique)
  - description (TextField)
  - created_at (DateTime)

-- Tags
Tag:
  - name (CharField, unique)
  - slug (SlugField, unique)
  - created_at (DateTime)

-- Posts
Post:
  - title (CharField, indexed)
  - slug (SlugField, unique, indexed)
  - author (ForeignKey to User)
  - content (TextField)
  - excerpt (TextField)
  - category (ForeignKey to Category)
  - tags (ManyToMany to Tag)
  - status (CharField: draft/published)
  - featured (Boolean, indexed)
  - published_at (DateTime, indexed)
  - created_at (DateTime)
  - updated_at (DateTime)
  - meta_description (CharField)
  - meta_keywords (CharField)

-- Comments
Comment:
  - post (ForeignKey to Post)
  - author (ForeignKey to User)
  - content (TextField)
  - parent (ForeignKey to self, for nested comments)
  - is_approved (Boolean)
  - created_at (DateTime)
```

## Security Implementation

### Authentication & Authorization
- Django's built-in authentication system
- Role-based permissions using decorators and mixins
- CSRF protection on all forms
- Secure password validation

### Content Security
- HTML sanitization for user-generated content
- File upload validation for images
- SQL injection prevention through ORM
- XSS protection via template escaping

### Production Security
- Environment variable configuration
- Debug mode disabled in production
- Secure cookie settings
- HTTPS enforcement ready

## Performance Optimizations

### Database Optimizations
- Strategic indexing on frequently queried fields
- Select_related and prefetch_related for query optimization
- Database connection pooling ready for production

### Frontend Optimizations
- Bootstrap CDN for faster loading
- Compressed static files with WhiteNoise
- Lazy loading for images
- Responsive images for different screen sizes

### Caching Strategy (Production Ready)
- Django's caching framework integration points
- Template fragment caching for complex views
- Static file caching headers

## API Design Patterns

### URL Structure
```
/ - Homepage (post list)
/posts/ - All posts
/posts/<slug>/ - Individual post
/posts/create/ - Create new post (authors only)
/posts/<slug>/edit/ - Edit post (author/admin only)
/category/<slug>/ - Posts by category
/tag/<slug>/ - Posts by tag
/search/ - Search results
/auth/ - Authentication endpoints
/admin/ - Django admin interface
```

### Form Handling
- Django Forms with Bootstrap styling
- Client-side and server-side validation
- CSRF protection
- File upload handling

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Planned)
```python
# Model Tests
- User profile creation and role assignment
- Post creation with all fields
- Comment threading and approval
- Category and tag relationships

# View Tests
- Authentication required views
- Permission-based access control
- Form submission and validation
- Search and filtering functionality

# Integration Tests
- Complete user workflows
- Post creation to publication
- Comment moderation process
- Admin panel functionality
```

### Test Coverage Goals
- Models: 95%+ coverage
- Views: 90%+ coverage
- Forms: 95%+ coverage
- Templates: Basic rendering tests

## Deployment Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
# Required
SECRET_KEY=django-secret-key
DEBUG=False
ALLOWED_HOSTS=your-domain.com

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@host:port/db

# Email (optional)
EMAIL_BACKEND=django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USE_TLS=True
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-app-password

# Static Files
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-aws-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-aws-secret
AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME=your-s3-bucket
```

### Heroku Deployment Steps
1. Create Heroku app: `heroku create your-app-name`
2. Add PostgreSQL: `heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev`
3. Set environment variables: `heroku config:set SECRET_KEY=...`
4. Deploy: `git push heroku main`
5. Run migrations: `heroku run python manage.py migrate`
6. Create superuser: `heroku run python manage.py createsuperuser`

### Production Checklist
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Database migrations applied
- [ ] Static files collected
- [ ] Superuser account created
