# MoSCoW Prioritization Framework

## üìä What is MoSCoW Prioritization?

**MoSCoW** is a prioritization technique used in project management and software development to categorize requirements based on their importance:

- **M** - **MUST have** (Critical/Essential)
- **S** - **SHOULD have** (Important/High Priority)  
- **C** - **COULD have** (Nice to have/Medium Priority)
- **W** - **WON'T have** (Not this time/Future consideration)
