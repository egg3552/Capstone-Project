### üèÜ **MoSCoW Prioritization Integration**

This project utilizes the **MoSCoW prioritization method** for requirement categorization:

- **üöÄ MUST Have**: Critical features essential for product success
- **üéØ SHOULD Have**: Important features that add significant value  
- **üìä COULD Have**: Nice-to-have features if time/resources permit
- **‚ùå WON'T Have**: Out of scope for current release

6. Deploy to staging for testing
7. Merge to `main` for production deployment

### **Testing Strategy**
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions/methods
